    summary: |
      This project proposes to develop an influence generator from waste heat from various sources. A Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) is an electrical generator that uses an array of thermocouples, which is a solid state device that converts heat generated by the decay of a radioactive material directly into electrical energy through a phenomenon called the Seebeck effect.
